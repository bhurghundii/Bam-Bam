# Bam-Bam
It's just NotePad with a side bar, a search bar and images.
So basically, a worse version of Apple Notes but for Windows under 200 lines of code.

# Purpose 

Bam Bam is for folks who, for whatever reason, cannot install their desired note taking software but want something similar to whatever Apple Notes is. Because no one deserves to use OneNote.

## What I have against OneNote 

It's dreadfully slow and clunky, and crashes my computer.

# Installation

Since it's only one file of 200 lines, you can just copy it and run it using Python. 

# Features
1. All the saving, opening, viewing etc. 
2. Markdown support
3. Images 
4. Search bar

# Things Missing 
- A better file explorer. You can use files but it's all treated as a flat file. I tried to implement a tree view but it was too much work.
- File Management. I decided to ignore this because I just could use my native OS file manager to manage files.
